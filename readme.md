# AES - Cryptography
## Overview 
  An awesome repository for encryption/decryption using the AES algorithm. 
The repository contains the following three processes: 
  - Encryption
  - Decryption 
  - Key Generation  

## Usage 
1. using your terminal, clone the project: `git clone https://.....` or click code tab, download zip file then extract it. 
2. open the project folder using your editor. 
3. enter your plaintext/ciphertext into plaintext.txt/ciphertxt.txt file for encryption/decryption. 
4. run main.py file, enter your key then choose encryption/decryption option.
5. output of encryption/decryption will be returned to ciphertxt.txt/plaintext.txt file. 
  
- NOTE: the key must be 32 digits in a hex format. Therefore, if your key not in hex, you can convert to hex format using prepareKey.py file 
## Notes File 
notes.txt file contains high-level code explanation and examples. 

## About AES
AES is a symmetric block cipher algorithm with a block/chunk size of 128 bits.
